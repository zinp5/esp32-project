NOTE THAT & todo

------TO DO------
wire cutter and stripper and soldering and raw wire


------------esp general---------------
aparently the esp32 pin #2 can manipulate the board's built-in LED,,, simply do :::: pinmode(2, OUTPUT)
if you wish to print something in setup (ie,, error checking) you must place a delay(minimum 275) after the serial.begin(9600) line
		failure to do so means the esp32 may send info before serial on the PC can read it
one day ::::: #include <Arduino.h> ::::: will be necessary


----------ir sensor-------------------
bright lights (ie your lamp) will activate the IR sensor 
this IR sensor will set input to LOW when there is detection

irpin only defines which pin to look at for incoming data
    to actually recieve that data, we need receiver = digitalRead(incomingpin)

we can utilize the led on the ir sensor by setting the IRpin pinMode to output 

ir current draw = 45mA

though the sensor will have trouble seeing object more than 4in away, 
    the sensor will pick up another IR signal (from another IRsensor) from 6+in

to mitigate noise / debounce the input signal, include a :::delay(1):::: at the end of your prog
	(something about clock and propogation time) ,, the input needs to be steady for a short period


---------detecting motion---------
motion is defined as an object being at a point different from the point it was at previously
i detect motion using a 1d array that holds two values, current(index 1) and previous(index 0)
    the method runs in three steps:
        first step: input >>> current
        check status
        second step: current >>> previous
    before second step I check status ::::if current != previous:::: then i deduce that something has moved / motion detected 
        (given that an object is at/not at the point that it was not at/was at previously)


--------------bluetooth------------
dont forget your laptop has a serial terminal tool
use #include "BluetoothSerial.h" is required

--------------------relay--------------------
our relay is controlled by 3v that can handle 5v (by means of octocoupling (whatever that is))
this video is really helpful (it shows how to wire it) ::::::::: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giACxpN0cGc&ab_channel=RuiSantos

the led on the relay only turns on when input is high (i fucking hate this btw) 
	iow, there is no power inticator LED

dont bother removing the jumpercovers on the unnamed pairs, not enitrely sure what they do
	according to my beloved chatgpt, 
		one pair toggles the octoupler isolation mode
		the other is trigger mode selection (LOW to set instead of HIGH)
		(iow dont bother with em)
